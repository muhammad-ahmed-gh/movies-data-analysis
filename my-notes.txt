1. I downloaded the datasets from IMDb and they contained tons
of data (title.basics.tsv contained 12 million rows)

2. I removed the rows that are \N or before 2000 (8 million rows)

3. Then I removed the rows that 2015 (4.5 million rows)

4. Then I kept only the records of Titletype = "movie" (200,000 rows)
